# Food-Delivery-Database-System
This is a project I completed for my Database Design and Database Administration class at NYU. 

## Task

Designed, created, and maintained a MySQL database, with 40+ tables, for an online food delivery system. 
Created advanced SQL scripts including stored procedures to create, store, and retrieve multiple data types.
Developed five complex queries for key inventory and sales metrics.

### Steps to Take for Running Scripts Successfully
Make sure to use Microsoft SQL Server Management Studio and create a new Database.
1. Run Advance(Create); 40+ tables using stored procedures.
2. Run Advance(BasicInsert); contains dummy data to make the database work.
3. Run insertPoc1 and insertValue1; these files inserts new data to the database using stored procedures.
4. Run InsertPoc2 and insertValue2
5. Run Advance(Select1); these files retrieve information within the database while utilizing stored procedures.
5. Run Advance(Select2)
5. Run Advance(Select3)
